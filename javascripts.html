    <h1>The Joys of Programming According to Savannah</h1>
    <p>
      This website is my portfolio of programs I have made. <br>First, here is some information about myself. I am currently a student
      at the University of Rhode Island, and I am a Computer Sience major. I am enrolled in the CSC 106 class called The Joy of Programming.
      <br>However, I do have three previous years of programming experience. In these three years I studies four languages: 
      Visual Basic, Python, C++, and Java.
