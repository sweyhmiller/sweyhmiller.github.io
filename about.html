    <p>
      My name is Savannah Weyhmiller. I am a Chemistry and Computer Science double major at the University of Rhode Island. <br>
      I have knowledge of 4 programming langauges and continue to learn more. My current language experiences include 
      Visual Basic, Python, C++, and Java. <br>I am a huge Harry Potter fan among other things. A lot of my more creative programs 
      are inspired by such things.<br> I hope you enjoy my programs as much as I enjoy making them.
